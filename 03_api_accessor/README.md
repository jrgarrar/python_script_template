### Author's Notes

`requests` is the Python library for GET, POST, and other HTTP requests.

I've used it in the past to fetch data files from publicly available sources and manage cloud servers. 

`bs4`, also known as Beautiful Soup, is a library for parsing HTML and XML. 

Together, these two can process quite a bit of the internet.
