### Author's Notes

`matplotlib` is a popular graphing library for Python, with support for numerous kinds of charts.

`seaborn` is a somewhat more niche graphing library. It functions similarly to `matplotlib`, and has support for a few specialized charts.

I've used both of these libraries to visualize numerical data. For example, comparing math and reading scores for high schoolers, or the frequency of help desk tickets across each day of each month.
